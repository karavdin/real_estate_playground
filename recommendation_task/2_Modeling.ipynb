    "Your task would be to develop a recommendation model that could recommend returning users new properties based on their old reviews. Let’s just assume that our platform has only vacation houses in London and we would like to recommend new properties only to our loyal returning users.\n",
    "## Data:\n",
    "As an input you get the London Airbnb Dataset where you can find user reviews and general information about listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables / outcome:\n",
    "Upon completion of your analysis, your presentation should encompass the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "• insights and challenges that you’ve faced during the discovery process,\n",
    "\n",
    "• results of the sentiment analysis, how you extracted signals for the recommendation model\n",

    "We use the k-means algorithm to cluster all the listings based on the reviews. The features would form the unsupervised clusters based on TF-IDF scores of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we do that ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each listings's reviews are collected and concatenated as a single string. Thus, each listings has the feature set of tf-idf scores for the concatenated string of reviews. Further the tf-idf scores as a feature set is used to find the euclidean distance between selected points in space, thus allowing us to implement the k-means algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is TF-IDF score ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a **document**(concatenated string of a listing) in a **corpus**(across the reviews of all listings), It tells how rarely a word occurs accross the corpus and how frequently it occurs in a that particular document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example for intution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider comparing reviews of chocolates. Let's assume there are three variants in chocolates available in the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Review for Variant 1*** : This is the best choclate in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Review for Variant 2*** : I liked this choclate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that similarity of two sentences here is based on Euclidean distance, the reviews would have closer distance due the presence of the word \" Chocolate\". \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there would a be lot of noice and misallocations, but it's possibility is very less as the reviews for rental places would involve some amount of context to express the thoughts. Also we concatenate all the reviews for the listing, which reduce the noise by considering the tf-idf scores for each word.\n"
